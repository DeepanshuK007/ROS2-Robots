# ROS2 Project: Optimized Autonomous Robots for Warehouse Operations

Welcome to the **ROS2 Autonomous Robotics Project** repository! This project leverages the power of **ROS2** to create a modular and highly efficient system for autonomous robots, designed with warehouse applications in mind. Whether you‚Äôre new to ROS2 or an experienced roboticist, this project aims to be an insightful resource for developing real-world robotic systems.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project is built to address common challenges in warehouse automation, such as object tracking, path optimization, and task automation. Our solution focuses on using ROS2 to build a scalable, flexible system that can:
- Track and manage objects in real-time.
- Optimize paths for efficient movement.
- Handle automated stacking and unloading tasks.

Key applications for this project include **warehouse stacking**, **inventory management**, and **autonomous navigation** in structured environments.

## üåü Features

- **Optimized Path Planning**: Robots find the shortest route to their targets using advanced pathfinding algorithms.
- **Real-Time Object Detection**: Integrates object detection capabilities for tracking and managing items in the warehouse.
- **Dynamic Task Allocation**: Robots automatically distribute tasks based on current workloads and locations.
- **Modular Architecture**: Easy to expand with new nodes for additional functionalities.
- **ROS2 Compatibility**: Fully built in ROS2, leveraging its enhanced communication, real-time capabilities, and modular design.

## üì¶ Installation Guide

Follow these steps to set up the project on your system.

### Prerequisites
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 22.04 (recommended)
- **ROS2 Distribution**: Humble Hawksbill or later
- **Other Dependencies**: Install other dependencies such as Python 3.x, OpenCV, and other ROS2 packages.

### Step 1: Install ROS2

If you don‚Äôt already have ROS2 installed, follow these steps:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository universe
sudo apt update
```

Install ROS2 (Humble or your preferred distribution):

```bash
sudo apt install ros-humble-desktop
```

Source your ROS2 setup script to include ROS2 in your environment variables:

```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
```

### Step 2: Set Up the Workspace

Create a new workspace (if not already set up) and clone this repository:

```bash
# Create workspace
mkdir -p ~/ros2_ws/src
cd ~/ros2_ws/src

# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-ros2-repository.git
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Navigate to the workspace and install all required dependencies using `rosdep`:

```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws
rosdep update
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
```

### Step 4: Build the Project

Build the project using `colcon`:

```bash
colcon build --symlink-install
```

### Step 5: Source the Workspace

Source the workspace to make sure ROS2 can locate the packages:

```bash
source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
```

### Step 6: Run the Nodes

You can now launch the nodes by running:

```bash
ros2 launch your_package_name your_launch_file.launch.py
```

Replace `your_package_name` and `your_launch_file.launch.py` with the specific names from this project.
